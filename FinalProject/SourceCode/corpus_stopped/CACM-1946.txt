computing polynomial resultants: bezout determinant
collins reduced algorithm
algorithms computing resultant
polynomials variables key repetitive
step computation solving systems polynomial
equations elimination studied determining
algorithm computer implementation depends
extent extraneous factors
introduced extent propagation errors caused
truncation real coefficients memory requirements
computing speed preliminary considerations narrow
choice algorithm bezout
determinant collins reduced polynomial remainder sequence
algorithm detailed tests performed
sample problems conclusively show bezout determinant
superior respects
univariate polynomials case collins reduced
algorithm faster
bezout determinant proves strikingly superior
numerical accuracy displaying excellent stability
