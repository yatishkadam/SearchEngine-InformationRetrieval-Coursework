remarks line segment curve-fitting dynamic programming
recent paper bellman showed dynamic
programming determine solution
problem previously considered stone problem
comprises determination
points subdivision interval
line segments give
squares fit function interval
bellman confined primarily
analytical derivation suggesting briefly
solution equation derived
point subdivision reduced
discrete search paper computational
procedure considered fully similarities
stone equations
shown equation involving
minimization found addition
shown bellman method applied
curve-fitting problem additional constraints
added ends line segments curve
