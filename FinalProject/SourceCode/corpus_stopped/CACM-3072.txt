model studies integrated feedback-driven
scheduling systems multiprogrammed- multiprocessor
computer systems presented basic control variables
data-flow rates processes
executing cpu model systems feature simulated
continuous-flow preempt-resume scheduling
input-output activity attention
amount memory resource required effective
processing activity buffer space assignment
model studies distribution-driven
trace-driven techniques simple dynamic
schedulers shown improve system performance
measured user cpu time optimal
near-optimal static schedulers imbeded
identical system structures workload environments
improvement greatest heavy
demand workload
