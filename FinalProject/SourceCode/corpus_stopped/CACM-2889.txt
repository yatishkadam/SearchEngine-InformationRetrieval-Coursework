hb trees shown statistic
hb 1 trees avl trees function
size tree time search item
tree sufficiently large trees
execution times procedures maintaining hb 1
trees independent size tree
average 465 restructures required
insertion average 2 78 nodes
revisited restore hb 1 property average
214 restructures required deletion
average 1 91 nodes revisited restore hb 1

order restore hb property trace back
cost maintaining hb trees drops sharply
allowable imbalance increases analytical
experimental results show cost maintaining
