------------------------------Merging the urls obtained------------------------------

List 1 = Urls obtained from task1 code (seed = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy)

List2 = Urls obtained from task3 code (seed = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power)

We can desing an algorithm such as the one described below:
Step 1: Pop the first element of List1 and add the element to Result if its not present
Step 2: If Result max length is met, exit  
Step 3: Pop the first element of List2 and add the element to Result if its not present
Step 4: If Result max length is met, exit
Step 5: Repeat from Step1

Note that we are popping the first element in each list to preserve the shallow links importance achieved by BFS Crawlers in task 1 and 3
